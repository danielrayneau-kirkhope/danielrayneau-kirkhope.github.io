I received my Ph.D. in 2012 from the University of Nottingham after defending my thesis “Statistical Physics of Structural Design”. I started work as an [Aalto Science Fellow][ascifellow] [Aalto University][aalto] in October 2012. In September 2015 I became an [Academy of Finland][aka] Postdoctoral researcher working within the group of [Olli Ikkala][olli]. 


My current research is in the field of biomimetic structures, structural optimisation and in particular the role of hierarchy in the creation of efficient structures. I am also fascinated by other problems within mechanics and elasticity; for example the role of geometry in obtaining novel mechanical properties is a fast moving research area in which I’m currently involved.
