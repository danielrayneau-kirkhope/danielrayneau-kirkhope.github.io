It has previously been shown that hierarchical designs can be used to create highly efficient load
bearing structures. The increase in efficiency is highlighted through a systematic ability to change the scaling
relationship between minimum volume of material required for stability and maximal load a structure can
withstand. The gain in efficiency when compared to a simple beam is found to increase as the loading magnitude
for which the structure is optimised is reduced. Here we investigate a single hierarchical structure optimised for
withstanding a compressive force. We show that through slight alteration of the frame geometry the efficiency
gains can be increased and the range of loading over which hierarchical designs are of interest can be increased.
Parameters of practical importance are calculated and discussed. These results suggest that through further
alteration of the space frame geometry the use of hierarchical geometries in practical optimisation problems can
become more widely applicable.
